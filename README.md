# Iris-species-classification system
The Iris Species Classification System is a simple command-line program in Python that uses the famous Iris dataset to train a classification model and predict the species of an Iris flower based on its features.

It demonstrates:
Loading and splitting data
Training a machine learning model
Making predictions
Evaluating the model
Ideal for beginners in Machine Learning and Python.

## Features
✅ Load the Iris Dataset
✅ Train a Model (using scikit‑learn)
✅ Evaluate Model Accuracy
✅ Predict New Inputs

## Technologies Used
Python 3
scikit‑learn (for ML)
pandas (for data handling)
numpy (for math operations)

## Usage
The program will:
Load the Iris dataset
Split it into training and test sets
Train a Logistic Regression model
Evaluate and display its accuracy
Prompt the user for new flower measurements
Predict the species (setosa, versicolor, or virginica)
